# CitrixLauncher-Public
By: Brian Korrow

Uses a trigger page set as the chrome browser home page to launch Workspace App.  Can be used like Windows startup. Waits 10-15 seconds for Workspace to install in managed guest session environments. 

Needs to be force installed on enterprise enrolled Chromebooks to function.
